		The inspiration behind this project:
	</p>

	<p>
		When I was browsing through the results of MotoGP, I was given PDFs of the results, the gaps between the riders, but I wanted something more. I wanted to know more, not just numbers and lists. I wanted interactive results. I wanted to understand the track layout, I wanted to see a video of this rider at that track. Why did this rider Withdraw? How much of a struggle did Marc Marquez go through to win 1st place in Motegi? 
	</p>

	<p>
		Sure, I can repeat the search again in the videos tab on motogp's site or do a youtube search, but you'd have to input the same keywords again.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since I navigated there the first time, the video and map should be there already!
	</p>

	<p>
		Hopefully I can implement all the data from every year soon.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoyed purusing through my site.
