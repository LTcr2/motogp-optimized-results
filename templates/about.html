				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>
					When browsing through the results of motorcycle races, we're often given the results as PDFs of numbers and lists. But oftentimes, riders and fans want a more contextualized understanding of what happened during the race. The gaps between first and second place are close. How close? What did the last battle look like? Why was this rider retired? Was it a mechanical issue or a crash? This site allows you to search for relevant video content while giving the user a layout of the track and videos of full laps, listed along with the final results and standings of each rider at each stage of the world championship.
